# Otterly Ridiculous History GOLANG edition!

#### Because building ORH once in Typescript wasn't enough - I've decided to build it - again - in GO!

## Otterly Ridiculous History is a web application that allows you play fun text adventure games featuring otters as the protagonists! The game interface has a terminal/retro styling, and we have cool pixel art throughout the site!

### New Features! 
- FULL SSR with enhanced SEO!
- A contact form that likely wont work because I'll forget to handle via AWS
- Absolutely NO new styling!
- Even more unfinished games that still need writing!
- Slower initial load times because SSR got drawbacks too yo
- More Otters!*

#### * actual number of otters may vary
