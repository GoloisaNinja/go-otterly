# Otterly Ridiculous History GOLANG edition!

## Because building ORH once in Typescript wasn't enough - I've decided to build it - again - in GO!

### New Features! 
- FULL SSR with enhanced SEO!
- A contact form that likely wont work because I'll forget to handle via AWS
- Absolutely NO new styling!
- Even more unfinished games that still need writing!
- Slower initial load times because SSR got drawbacks too yo
- More Otters!*

#### * actual number of otters may vary

### Still under construction
### TODO
