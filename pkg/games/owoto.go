			Text:               `The world is dark and quiet. Or, at least, it was. You are aware of something rhythmic. It’s just at the edge of your perception. But it’s there. Thudding, or maybe, rapping. It grows in intensity until finally you recognize it as an alarm sounding off. Light creeps into the corners of your field of vision and you slowly, arduously, open the heavy lids of your eyes. Blurry at first, your vision finally focuses somewhat and you can see that you are in a cryo-pod. You are suspended in gooey cryo-gel, but through the pod’s forward window, you can see the cryo-bay. There are lockers, a few terminal stations, and there’s a light on the far wall. The light is flashing red. The thudding of the alarm is muted through the gel, but it’s definitely a ship’s alarm sequence. Something is wrong! There doesn’t appear to be anyone in the pod bay. No one to let you out? What is going on? Looks like you’ll have to get out of this pod yourself. But your memory is so foggy from the after-effects of cryo-sleep. Wait. How do you even know that? Whatever, you’ll figure that out later. The point is, there’s got to be a way to exit the pod from the inside. But how? You glance around the inside of the pod. There are all the various tubes keeping you alive and such, and then you spot it. It’s some kind of user panel. The panel is protected from the cryo-gel but appears to be accessible by some physical switches. There’s two switches that grab your attention. One labeled with the characters “ECPP”, and another labeled “EPEP”. Your brain tells you these are significant. You just can’t remember why! Blasted cryo-mind-fog! You’ve got to get out of this pod. Time to make a choice - which switch do you want to activate?`,

You slam the switch labeled ECPP and quickly look to the user panel for some feedback. There are a series of muted clicks and you can hear some kind of motorized servo engaging somewhere. This is good! It’s probably the main pod chamber release! Even with cryo-brain-fog you are a genuine, rockstar genius of unfathomable proportion. Suddenly you see a flash across the user panel. The text is bold but it’s so small and hard to read through the cryo-gel. Who designed this crap? You try to rub your eyes, but that actually makes things worse. The text on the user panel keeps changing. Ugh. What does that say? Then you hear several, very serious sounding clicks. No, not clicks. Legitimate thuds. Like, very loud, concerning, thuds. You finally realize the user panel text keeps changing because, well, it’s a countdown. As your cryo-gel covered body is ejected into the cold vastness of space, you suddenly remember that ECPP stands for Evacuate Cryo Pod and Purge. Would have been nice to have remembered that 2 minutes ago. Thanks brain. Before the last breath in your lungs freezes and everything goes black, you curse the makers of the user panel for their poor font family and font size choices. Game Over.`,

There are no colors or warnings to indicate that one switch is better than the other. Argh, this brain fog is so frustrating! You slam the switch labeled EPEP and quickly look to the user panel for some feedback. You can hear several clicks and the whirring of a motor somewhere. The user panel is flashing some information very quickly across the screen, but the text is so small, you can’t make out what’s happening. Suddenly there is an extremely loud hissing sound that nearly shatters your ear drums, followed by a deep, resonating thud. You are violently ejected from the cryo-pod. All the monitoring nodes and tubes are unceremoniously ripped off or out of you. A speaker near the pod you just got eject from says “Emergency Pod Eject Procedure…is now complete…have a nice day”. Oh right. That’s what EPEP means. Now you remember. Hmm. Still can’t remember what that other switch stands for though. You cough and your throat is scratchy from just having a breathing tube ripped from it, but you glance around the pod bay. All the other pods are empty. You can hear the alarm more clearly now, it’s very annoying, and your vision is clearing up. You move to the lockers and instinctively pick the second one from the right. There’s a blue uniform inside. The patch on the arm reads “One Way Or the Otter”, and the patch on the chest reads “Titan Station - LHF - Liquid HydroCarbon Frigate”. The uniform doesn’t quite fit. You must have put on some weight in cryo-sleep. You look in the mirror next to the lockers and instantly recognize your face. You are an adorable otter. Almost too adorable. And this uniform. Wow. It’s smashing on you. I mean you look fantastic. Just as you’re about to give yourself some finger guns and a few winks. The ship violently jerks to port, throwing you into the row of lockers. A whole new set of alarms start blaring. This is not good. You are trying to desperately to remember who you are. But it’s a total fog. Regardless, you need to do something. And fast! You see what looks like a communication panel on the wall by the only door in the cryo-bay. You could try to use the ship’s general comms and see if anyone responds? You can’t be on this ship alone, can you? Another part of you is thinking that the insane, and violent movement the ship just experienced can only be explained by a problem with the engines. You aren’t sure how you know that, but you’re pretty sure you know that. And yet, still another part of you thinks, that with how good looking you are, that it’s entirely possible, and indeed, likely that you are the captain of this ship called the “One Way or the Otter”. And captains belong on the bridge! What are you going to do?`,

You should try and get someone on the comms panel to tell you what the devil is going on around here! The ship pitches violently, yet again, this time tossing you almost entirely back into your recently evacuated cryo-pod. You extricate yourself and move hurriedly to the comms panel. The alarms are blaring so loudly now and it’s clear the ship is in serious trouble. The comms panel is pretty foreign to you at the moment. It’s just a screen with some kind of ship’s operating system. There"s a menu option near the top that says utilities and after clicking that you see a communication channel option. You select “general comms” and start screaming into the screen, hopeful but unsure if there’s even a microphone anywhere on this thing. At first there’s no response. You repeat your plea for someone, anyone, to answer you, to tell you what’s going on. Finally, you hear a crackle and hiss emit from the speaker near the panel. “Who is this, listen…*static*...ship is…*static*... we need …*static*... comm array is damaged …*static*... forward comm hatch …*static*... help… *transmission cuts out*”. You’re not alone! There’s another otter on the ship! The transmission was super garbled, but it sounded like the otter on the otter end (so clearly you love puns - awesome) was asking for help with some kind of comms array. It makes sense that if the ship was in trouble, that you’d be trying to reach out to maybe request a rescue, or assistance. You’d better get to the forward comms hatch right away! Then again, there’s part of you that wonders if the ship is damaged as badly as it seems, do you really have time to fix the comms array if it’s broken? You could very well be the captain, it might be best to get to the bridge and get a complete situation report. And yet again, there may be no time for that either. I mean the ship really seems like it’s coming apart! Your best shot at saving your adorable otter booty, not to mention the other otters on board, might be getting to Engineering to see if you can fix the engine! What are you going to do?`,

With the ship pitching and jostling around the way it is, there’s only way to save this flying hunk of metal, and that’s the Engine Room. Your gut tells you that there’s probably some problem with the DyLithium Crystals or some such thing, which seems totally reasonable. You exit the cryo-bay and are immediately tossed like a rag doll down the corridor as the ship violently pitches forward. Or at least you perceive it to be “forward”. I mean who knows? Space is weird. You crash into a bulkhead, but luckily, you don’t seem to have hurt your perfect cheekbones, so that’s a plus. You also spot a graphic printed on the bulkhead. The graphic indicates a ship in flight. I mean, that’s gotta be engineering, right? You dust yourself off and begin making your way down the corridor. You are about halfway down the corridor when there’s a horrific sound of metal bending and flexing before finally groaning and giving way. Suddenly all of the oxygen in the corridor is rushing past you and you realize there’s been a hull breach! Somewhere behind you in the corridor, an entire portion of the ship has been sheared off! You desperately grab onto a rail that runs the length of the corridor into the next section of the ship. It’s not far! You could get there and close the bulkhead and repressurize that section. But you had better move fast! That’s when you hear it, it’s muted at first, probably just your ears adjusting to the horrible sound of your impending death. But then it gets louder. It’s a voice! You glance behind you and see another otter, in a uniform just like yours. They are much closer to the hull breach and it looks like they can’t hold on! You also notice on the other side of the corridor, opposite of the crew member, there’s a tool belt that’s gotten caught on some debris near the breach. The oxygen in this section is almost gone. You need to act quickly. The safest thing to do would be to just get to the bulkhead and seal off the damaged section. You could try to save the crew member, of course you both might die from getting sucked out to space or suffocation. Then there’s the tool belt. You can’t fix ship engines without tools. That’s basic engineering. But the tools are on the total opposite side of the corridor from the crew member. You can’t get the tools AND save the crew member. And getting the tools could get you killed too. So what do you want to do? `,

Miss half a season because of random "shore leave" etc. But captains…ohh captains, good looking ones especially, their episode percentage is high nineties. You need to be on the bridge. You aren"t sure why your crew left you alone in the cryo-bay (you"ll need to throw a few of them in the brig to reestablish dominance) but you"d like some answers. That, and regardless of what is wrong with the ship, it"ll be easier to figure out next steps from the one place on the ship that has comfy chairs. Your mind is still pretty foggy, but you are almost positive that the bridge is on one of the upper levels compared to the cryo-bay. You are also pretty sure that there is an authorization access protocol that is managed by cards and codes. You quickly pat the pockets of your ill-fitting jumpsuit. Nothing. No card. Strange. You head back to your locker and search it thoroughly as well. Nope. No card. Then it hits you. It"s pretty obvious what happened here. Some otter crewmate woke up from their cryo-sleep and had brain fog and stole your uniform and card key! They probably even think they"re the captain! This situation is so not on. As the ship experiences yet another bone-rattling, well, rattle, you figure you"ve got two ways to approach this. Like any good captain, you are positive you"ve got extra access credentials lying around in your quarters somewhere. You could try and  make a quick detour and hopefully snag your deets before the ship does its best impression of Coke meets Mentos. Or, like any devilishly good looking character in random and fairly generic space sci-fi movies, you could totally just wing it and head up to the bridge with literally no plan or credentials. Relying solely on your cheekbones, smile, and excessive amounts of absolute sauce to save the day. What to do, what to do?`,

At the very least, you know there’s a crew member that is working in the forward comms area of the ship. And what’s more, the crewmember seemed to be asking for help. If you could get the comms fixed there’s a good chance you could relay that the One Way or The Otter was in trouble. Surely Starfleet or the Rebel Alliance, or even the Empire or whatever could send some help and get you off this rust bucket! With your mind made up, you dash out of the cryo-bay and make towards, what in your gut tells you, is the forward comms array hatch. After a few unsteady falls, this way and that, as the ship continues to pitch and yaw, you finally approach a sealed bulkhead. There’s a diagram above the bulkhead that indicates that both medical and comms are just beyond. You do a little otter shoulder shrug dance, as clearly your brain fog is starting to lift! Your dance celebration is short lived however. You’re hitting the “open bulkhead” command on the side panel but absolutely nothing is happening. No sound. No movement. Nothing! Argh, this day suuucks! Ok, ok, think. Given how good looking you are, you are at the very least a high ranking officer on this ship, and at best, you might even be captain. And that means you know this ship in and out. There are three ways you could force this hatch. One, you could rip open the side panel and rewire power to the door’s hydraulics. This should get the hatch working normally again and splicing wires looks cool. Two, there are manual hatch release levers in the emergency panels near every hatch. You can grab the MHRL and with a bit of elbow grease, you should be able raise the hatch just enough to crawl under. Three, there are electrical conduits running the span of a small trench beneath the deck grating under your feet. Clearly they move beyond the hatch and into comms. There’d be a pressurized panel in the trench for conduit access and repair. As long as the panel control isn’t damaged, you should be able to get it open and slip right through. Although, getting the deck grating up could be a pain. What should you do though?`,

You grapple for a moment about the moral quandary of leaving a fellow otter to die, but how many more otters are on this ship? As your father used to say, “the needs of the mayonnaise outweigh the needs of the sun, or the stew”. No wait. That wasn’t it. Whatever, your brain is still pretty mushy. The point is. You’ve got to get those tools if you and the possibly thousands of otter otters (still with the puns) on this ship are going to survive! You use all your otter strength to turn yourself around, towards the hull breach. You are feeling light headed already which is NOT a good sign. Oxygen is getting low. The crew otter is yelling for help and something about having kids, yada yada. Your focus is on the tool belt. It’s snagged on a piece of debris, but it’s not going to last much longer. In the coolest, and most badass way you can think of, you leap to the other side of the corridor and grab onto the rail on that side just in time before you’re evacuated into the cold blackness of space. You are only a meter (thank god you’re not an empirical units otter) away from the belt. The crew otter realizes what your doing and curses you. Somewhere between him screaming, how, and why, and deary me, you snag the tool belt! Huzzah! Just as the belt is firmly in your otter paws, there’s a massive explosion somewhere else on the ship. It causes the ship to violently pitch and the sad little crew otter loses his grip. He gives you finger as he recedes into the spinning blackness. Harsh. There’s no time to mourn. Any longer here and you’re going to pass out or lose your grip too. You make your way back up the corridor to the bulkhead and finally slam the emergency breach control module. A heavy breach shield is lowered from the ceiling and the corridor goes almost deathly quiet. You are gasping for every breath you can get. You have the toolbelt. You are alive. But you also might be cursed now. Depends on if that otter knew voodoo or whatever. You feel another shudder travel through the ship’s walls and floor. Another distant explosion? Are you under attack or something? Maybe you should have gone to the bridge afterall? It’s too late now. At this point, you could keep traveling through the corridors to try and reach Engineering. It would be fast. But with the ship coming apart, you could also opt to use the maintenance shafts. It would be A LOT slower, but the maintenance tunnels are reinforced and often have portable oxiunits so they can be used even when the ship isn’t fully pressurized, damaged, or there’s a lack of oxygen. In other words. It would be safer. But it’s only safer if the whole ship doesn’t explode. Arghh. What should you do?`,

With your adorable little otter paws, you ferociously rip off the casing of the hatch panel display. You might have been a little too rough and several wires tumble out of the panel housing onto the deck. You scoop them up quickly, shove them into your uniform,  and act like nothing happened, just in case anyone caught this on some kind of hidden ship cam. The panel is sparking randomly and you can smell ozone, which is maybe, not great. No matter. There are nests of wires everywhere and just as you are thinking that maybe this was the wrong call, you spot a particularly large black wire. Upon closer inspection, it’s not a wire, it’s a hydraulic line! There’s also a  small circuit panel labeled “hydraulic controller” that has a clearly damaged wire dangling nearby! But just as you are trying to reconnect the broken wire to the controller board, you notice the hydraulic line is spewing fluid. Lots of fluid. Ugh, even if you could make a good connection back to the controller board, there’s no way the hydraulics will get enough fluid to operate the hatch. You can’t worry too much about the time you just wasted, you’ll either run out of time or you won’t. At this point you could try the conduit trench, or you could also grab the MHRL from the emergency panel and get the comms hatch open manually. What do you want to do?`,

They fit into a tool access port near the hatch and by rotating the MHRL you can raise/ratchet the hatch open bit by bit. It’s time consuming to get a hatch fully open, but you only need enough space so you can crawl under. You find the emergency panel and retrieve the MHRL. And now, like some kind of space janitor, you begin the disgusting manual task of opening the hatch. There is a reason captains have crew to do this stuff for them, you think to yourself as you bemoan how low you’ve sunk. Just as you are daydreaming about how you’re going to court martial your entire crew for insubordination, there’s a MASSIVE explosion that rocks the ship! You are thrown into the wall near the hatch access with a sickening thud. You are seeing stars for the first several seconds following the explosion, but slowly, your vision returns to normal. That was, definitely, not good. It felt like the ship might’ve just lost an entire level! Whatever is happening is getting worse. You’ve got to get through this hatch and fix that comms array before it’s too late! There is just enough space between the hatch and the deck for you to slip through. But it’s going to be really, really, tight. It’ll take another few minutes to raise the hatch any higher. And the explosion definitely made the hatch slide down a few teeth off the manual chain mechanism. Decision time - you can either try and time your dive under the hatch and hope there are no more big explosions, or you can take a few minutes and try to raise the hatch a bit higher for safety. You hate both these options, but you really don’t see any other way. What do you want to do?`,

Ever since waking up in that cryo-pod, what seems like days ago, you’ve been so lonely and with the ship coming apart you’ve really felt scared and stressed. Seeing another otter just finally gives you that sense of peace, like you aren’t alone in all this chaos. Like you can finally breathe a sigh of relief knowing that it’s all going to be okay because you finally found a friend! You can’t hold back your excitement and joy as you scream, sing-song-like, into the microphone - “Hellllooooo, IS IT ME YOU’RE LOOKING FOOOOOOR!”. You hear the otter in the space suit scream out, scared and startled. You might have screamed a little too loudly? As you check the monitor, you can see that the little communications space otter has lost their grip on the antenna array. You see a tether extending out from the suit. Phew! Close one. Good thing this comms otter has their stuff together. They can just pull themselves back to the comms antenna array. No harm, no foul! Just as you are about to apologize to the adorable little space otter for startling them - they get absolutely pancaked by a large piece of debris that the ship spun into. You actually wince as you watch the horror on the monitor. You look around the comm room for a moment. “If anyone saw that - I mean, obviously it wasn’t my fault.” you say out loud. That otter really should have had less slack on that tether. You can’t be held responsible for when otters don’t follow protocol afterall. Anyway, it’s probably no big deal. That otter was likely almost done fixing everything anyway. Excitedly, you engage the “ALL COMM CHANNELS EMERGENCY” button and prepare your best captain voice for the part where you’ll say your crew sucks and you need saving. Except, the button doesn’t light up and the status panel in front of you still only indicates “EEV CHANNEL” as being fully operational. As a piece of debris the size of a small moon crashes through the hull, crippling the ship and decompressing every deck simultaneously, you can’t help but think how your crew really let you down.

You are too beautiful to die in space! All this stupid panel had to do was light up the EMC button! That’s all! You rewired the stupid thing like some kind of Weasel MacGyver and what? NOTHING! You land a particularly vicious kick which, in turn, cracks your little toe bones sending arcs of shooting pain up through your leg. You howl in pain and frustration and start hopping around on your one good leg. A particularly large explosion rocks the ship, yet again, and sends you hopping out of the comms room, off balance, down the corridor into the medical bay. You are so off balance and just trying to keep from falling and hurting yourself more as you fly into a corner filled with oxygen tanks in the medical bay. There are loud clunks and bangs all around you as the oxygen tanks clatter all over the floor. In what could possibly be the most ridiculous Rube Goldberg mechanism you’ve ever seen, an oxygen tank rolls along the med-bay, slams into a med-card, which in turn, causes the med-cart drawers to fly open. Another jolt from the ship causes all the scalpels in med-cart drawer to come flying out like something out of a Spruce Lee (the amazing kung-fu otter from Canada) movie. The scalpels puncture a bunch of IV bags causing their liquid to squirt out everywhere and in all directions. Some of the IV fluid sprays over one of the portable defibrillator units nearby and causes a shower of sparks. It would be almost beautiful if you weren’t collapsed amongst a scattered array of leaking oxygen tanks. The ensuing explosion is massive enough to be catastrophic for the One Way or the Otter. As both you and the Medical Bay are first, engulfed in flames, then shot out into space in the resulting decompression, you can’t help but think. Worth it. That stupid comms panel is now also dead. It’s a hollow victory. But it’s still a victory. Game Over.`,

No. NO! THAT’S IT! You have absolutely had it. You feel the weight of the MHRL bouncing in your uniform as you begin floating like a butterfly around the comms panel. “So that’s how you wanna do me Comms Panel?” you scream like a crazy otter. “THAT’S HOW YOU WANNA DO ME?? YOU WANNA DO ME DIRTY!” you howl. You take the MHRL from your uniform and begin bashing the comms panel like it took your money. You are utterly relentless. The violence and frustration of the whole day pours out of you like an energy drink being shotgunned by an awkward teenager on TikTok. And then suddenly, through your red haze of anger, you perceive a light. It almost doesn’t register at first. But there it is. The EMC button is lit! THE EMC BUTTON IS LIT! You drop the MHRL and rapidly begin pushing the EMC button, over, and over, and over again! Suddenly the EEV otter comes screaming across the channel. “YOU DID IT, OH MY GOD YOU ACTUALLY DID IT!”. The EEV otter is hooting and hollering and doing (rather appropriately) a moonwalk celebration dance. The comms channels suddenly crackle to life with a repeating transmission from Titan alerting the One Way or the Otter that a rescue ship has been dispatched. As you collapse into one of the chairs in front of the comm panel, you can’t help but think what a great captain you are. What skill and prowess you possess to be able to solve such complex problems in a life and  death situation. Much later in your debrief, you’ll be asked how you managed to repair a comms panel that had, so clearly, been viciously damaged. One interviewer will comment how the comms panel “...appeared to have been severely dented and nearly catastrophically bashed.”. You only respond that there was a lot of debris flying around the ship. You wonder how the damage occurred as well, but it must’ve happened amongst all the chaos of the ship pitching and spinning. You’ll smile to yourself as you say this and you’ll go back to your quarters and kiss the MHRL that you’ve framed behind glass. Only a true captain could bash the crap out of something and get it to work like that. You smile again as settle into your little otter bed, content in knowing that you saved the day. But just before you doze off to sleep, you realize. Wait. No one in that debrief ever called you Captain. Your eyes burst open.

There are several drawers, but one in particular grabs your attention. There’s been a locking mechanism installed. By default, all desk drawers in an otter’s quarters are “locked” to their specific biometric signature. But this otter felt the need to install a 3rd party, analog lock. Interesting. You grab one of the nearby rocks on the ground and bash the heavy lock until your head is ringing and your cute little otter hand is throbbing. You are about to call it quits, when the lock finally fails and makes a muted crunching sound as the internal tumblers disengage from your unceremonious bashing. You slip the lock and open the drawer. It’s completely empty. Wait? It’s completely empty? Your adorable little otter paw is almost bleeding, and this freaking drawer is empty! You kick the stupid drawer for being so stupid and in the process stub your little otter foot quite badly. As you are hopping around in pain, you accidentally hop on a rock that’s still on the ground and howl in pain, falling backwards into the drawer. You hit the drawer with such force that the drawer completely comes off the track. As the drawer shatters you spot a secret compartment! You smile to yourself. “Just as I suspected” you exclaim with a little otter fist pump. You’re like the smartest otter ever. You remove the false panel and remove the slim contents of the false bottom. It’s an old, analog, photograph. Most companies stopped producing actual film decades ago. It’s mainly produced now, in small batches, for artists and whatnot. The photograph is of an alien lifeform and has features akin to spiders back on Earth. There are multiple elongated leg-like appendages that are connected to a much smaller, but bulkier body or carapace. Your mind almost seizes on what you’re looking at, but then falls short. This cryo-fog is pure hell. You feel like you know what this creature is. Maybe even WHO, this creature is…But you can’t place it. The creature is very small in the picture and looks to be fairly young, for whatever reason, you feel like if you do know this creature, you know it when it’s much older. Looking closer, you can see there is something that didn’t quite make the frame of the photograph. It almost looks…no…it’s just too blurry and cut off, you can’t make it out.

Why would some, obvious lunatic, pull their bed so that it sticks out from the wall at the bottom of the bed, but is flush with the wall at the top of the bed. It’s ludicrous. Unless of course there was something towards the back end of the bed? You shine the flashlight in that direction and move to the back of the askew bed. It’s pulled away from the wall alright, and now you can see why. There’s a fairly large hole that has been, literally, cut out by a scorcher. Scorcher’s are tools used by otters in engineering to cut bulky pieces of large metal plating. Wait, how do you know that? Anyway, there’s a massive hole that’s been cut into this wall.

The room has a similar layout to the one next door, the only difference being that it’s slightly larger to accommodate several extra ship console screens. That makes sense. You’d want to monitor all aspects of the ship’s operations from here, and thus would enjoy having several extra consoles, comparatively to the other otter officers. You spot the desk near the door and scramble towards it. You can’t help but notice the door. It’s jammed shut, from the inside.

You take another look around the room and notice that in addition to the desk, the ship consoles, the bed, and the small end tables, there is also an Otter-Secur-a-Station 9000 in the corner. These are highly sophisticated, googleplexity encrypted, storage lockers that have onboard data storage as well as physical storage. And the 9000 series is the absolute gem of all the Secur-a-Station models. Again, no idea how you actually know that, but anyway. You approach the Secur-a-Station.

Your creds are likely behind this door. All you need to do is clear this ridiculous cryo-fog! The input terminal is flashing with 5 little hashes - so you suspect the code is 5 numbers.

You quickly do some head maths. If the panel takes letters and numbers, that’s um, 26 + 10, so that’s 36 individual possibilities for each of the 5 required entries. Okay, um, carry the one…so it feels…um, like a high number of probabilities. I mean we could be talking like well over 60 combinations here! As you are contemplating how bad you might be at maths, the ship pitches once again, jarring you from your internal promises to maybe take some classes. Screw it. You coded this thing right?

There are numerous data pads, an array of very beautiful rocks (which make you go googly eyed for a minute), and some random medals, probably given to you for being awesome, in the Secur-a-Station interior. Then, you finally spot what you’ve been looking for. There’s a small, magnetic, sleeve that contains a very official (and shiny) looking access card. The sleeve looks like it is meant to simply stick to your uniform. The access card has a security designation of “All-Access: Code Otterman Empire” printed above a QR code. ERMERGERD Yasssssss!! You ACTUALLY found your bridge creds! You can finally make your way to the bridge, take command from the brain–fogged otter that is impersonating you (and doing an absolutely crap job of saving the ship by the way) and save the day! Woot! The ship is violently pitching on a regular basis - you need to get to the bridge. Now!`,

More blaster shots sizzle past the workstation you are hiding under. You take a second to survey the scene as best you can from under the workstation. The bridge is in shambles.

There’s a smoky haze hanging in the air from all the busted electronics. I guess now you know why the ship has been crashing all over the place. A few more shots hit the wall behind you and a waterfall of sparks pour out of the now blackened, and crispy, screen that used to be an engineering readout.

You are about to give up hope when you spot it, there’s a sizable gap near the upper portion of the rightmost corner of where the blast door has extended down from the ceiling. Your guess would be that one of the impacts the ship took packed enough punch to literally dislodge the blast door from the recessed housing that guides it. This bent out the housing and made a gap before the blast door settled back into place. With a little frantic scurrying, you are able to climb up to the gap and slip inside! The blast door housing is pretty spacious given how thick they are. Once up inside the housing, you can see that you’re in something of a sub-ceiling, and it looks to run just far enough into the bridge that you can hopefully find a spot to drop down in! This is a massive security concern. You’ll need to throw your engineer out of an airlock and get a new one that can fix this travesty. But for now, you’re grateful that the gap is a thing. You discover some ducting that looks to be something of an air exchange system, likely a carbon dioxide scrubber. You can actually hear sounds coming from the bridge below! It’s muted, but there’s definitely sound transferring. This has to be your way in. Just as you are about to call out for some assistance, it’s like the entire sub-ceiling is filled with sizzling heat, sparks, and utter chaos. At first, you’re not even sure what’s happening, but then it becomes pretty clear that someone on the bridge is firing a blaster up at you! What? Seriously? You are trying to save this stupid ship and this is the thanks you get? Soooo typical. You barely have time to lament the shortcomings of your unappreciative crew before you are falling through the sub-ceiling. Obviously, the sub-ceiling sustained enough damage from the blaster shots such that it could no longer sustain the weight of your adorable little otter body. You fall, unceremoniously, into the bridge and land with a thud behind a navigation console/workstation. Whoever is shooting at you is now more determined than ever to vaporize you, or at least, that’s your assessment given the blaster fire only increases now that you’re on the bridge.

Even with hiding under/behind this workstation, you can, more or less, tell where the blaster fire is coming from. The workstation you are using for cover, like most workstations on the ship, has an access panel that can be removed for making general repairs and accessing various internal components. It should be thick enough to act as a pretty good shield against blaster fire, if you wanted to try bumrushing your attacker. It would be pretty freaking heroic to go over the top of this workstation, all captain america style, and bash the crap out of whoever is shooting at you. Of course, if the panel isn’t thick enough, you could also end up, like sort of dead. Which would be less than ideal. You could also try calling out, maybe find out what this is all about? Negotiating maybe? I mean, this could all just be one big misunderstanding right? You could also totally make a run for it. I mean, there’s gotta be an escape pod around here somewhere, right?

With one of its many arms, or legs, or, whatever, it lifts you up and suspends you in midair, upside down. The blaster is pointed directly at you. You can see a group of crew members behind the pirate - they are being restrained in some kind of electro-field generator.

Despite how freaking cool that might be. And running for it? Well, actually, that seems like kind of a good idea, but it’s too late now, you’ve settled on negotiating! After another barrage of blaster fire, you clear your little otter throat, and in your best captain voice, you belt out your opening move. “Listen up you backstabbing piece of garbage. I will literally DIE before I let you take my ship!”. Admittedly, it’s not a great opener for dialog exchange. But it definitely gets a response. A gruff voice calls back. “Oy - so you’re the captain eh? Well then, who is this mug I’ve got trapped over here then?”. Ugh. You knew it. You FREAKING knew it. “Look, that captain-wannabe-jerkface has been the absolute BANE of my day, ok? He gets out of cryo-sleep and steals my uniform and my stuff! That otter is NOT the captain. At best, that otter, is like, maybe, a canteen worker or something! Something lame!” you shout. Another barrage of blaster fire sizzles over your head. “I just don’t believe you little otter.” the gruff voice responds. Peeking beneath the workstation, you get a glimpse of your attacker. You wondered why he’d call you “little otter” if he, too, was also an otter. But he’s not an otter at all. No. He’s something otter than an otter. He’s spider-like, and he’s got multiple arms, or legs, or whatever. He’s holding the blaster in one of the arm-thingies, and he’s got some hostages behind him in some kind of “electro-field” generator. Oh wow. Your ship has literally been boarded by freaking space pirates. That would be so badass, if it also didn’t suck so much. “You’re going to have to prove to me who you are little otter, or I’m going to melt your face.

It was supposed to come out more captain-y, but your voice kinda cracked and now it’s a little awkward. The pirate examines your creds and makes a “hmph” sound. The pirate glances back at an otter being restrained within the electro-field, the otter’s uniform is missing a fairly large patch of cloth that looks like it got ripped away. The pirate turns back to you. “So it’s you. Is it really you? Can it be?” the pirate says with astonishment. Ok. Ok. This is working. The space pirate IS in awe of your captain majesty! “Yes. It is I, my good space pirate. I. Am. The…” you start to say before the pirate cuts you off. “GREATEST THIEF OF ALL TIME!” the pirate exclaims. “I mean hold on. HOLD ON. Did you actually crack, like ACTUALLY CRACK, the Secur-a-Station model 099A to get these? Omg, you did. You actually did! You cracked a Secur-a-Station model 099A!” the pirate beams with absolute adoration. “I mean we tried to break into the Captain’s quarters when we first boarded the ship to get these! But the captain over there (the pirate motions to the otter with a patch of missing uniform) jammed the door and escaped some other way and sealed off the bridge with blast doors before we could get here! I mean, thankfully we had someone on the inside, but this is still INCREDIBLE! We heard that OTTERESSENCE had been captured, but we didn’t believe it!” the pirate blurts out. And there it is. Suddenly your memory comes flooding back. You aren’t the captain of the One Way or the Otter. You were captured by her. They chucked you in cryo-sleep until they could get you back to a federated station and turn you in for the bounty! You had snuck on board near Titan in hopes of siphoning off some of the liquid hydrocarbons they had on board, but you got caught! The pirate claps you on the back. “You are like my ultimate hero, seriously, you are the best!” the pirate gushes. You laugh awkwardly as you attempt to play this cool. But right now there are two things running through your mind. One. You need to get to an escape pod and get out of here. Two. You have the STUPIDEST thief name there ever was. Like seriously. OTTERESSENCE? You sign a few autographs for the pirates and make your way to an escape pod. A quick check of nav system and you’re pretty sure where you need to go. Your crew will be holed up on Phobos waiting for you to return. As your pod falls away from the One Way or the Otter, you plot a course for Mars. You’ve got stuff to steal, and a name change form to file. *COMMAND ARC - THIEF ENDING ACHIEVED - CONGRATULATIONS - GAME OVER*`,

			Text:               `You aren’t entirely sure why, but you hand the space pirate the photo you found in the desk back in the crew quarters. I mean, the thing in the picture kinda looks like this pirate, so who knows, maybe it’ll get you a little good will? The pirate takes the photo and stares at it for what seems like ages. Crap. This was a bad idea. You are about to grab a nearby piece of debris and book a one way ticket to otter bashy town, but the pirate finally speaks. “I can’t believe it. I can’t believe it. I’m actually in the presence of greatness. It’s an honour sir!” the pirate exclaims. You look to one side, and then the other. Surely, there’s someone standing beside you. But no. He is indeed addressing you. You are about to speak, but the pirate cuts you off. “Colonel Dregg didn’t think you were still alive! That’s why he sent us to take the ship! I mean, he told us all about your plan to infiltrate the crew of the One Way or the Otter and steal the ship AND the liquid hydrocarbon payload, but after you went dark, we assumed the worst! The Colonel said you’d have this picture of him as a kid, as proof of your identity, as a failsafe!” the pirate gushes. Suddenly, all the memories come flooding back, pushing away the cryo-induced brain fog. You aren’t the captain of the One Way or the Otter, you infiltrated the crew and became Number One. The whole time your intention was to hijack the ship and meet up with Colonel Dregg and the other pirates! The desk you found that photo in, was yours! Everything was going to plan, you were able to ingratiate yourself to the captain and crew. You had learned the ship operations and even spent one whole rotation learning the route and contact protocol at the hydrocarbon base on Titan. But then it had all gone sideways. The captain had caught you trying to get an encrypted message out and tossed you into the cryo-bay until they could figure out what to do with you. It all takes a second to sink in. “I AM. THE GREATEST PIRATE. ALIIIIIVEEEEEE!” you exclaim. You start something between a chicken dance and an electric slide, with the pirate next to you joining in. You finally get control of the ship and send the crew out in evac pods. The ship is pretty damaged from the whole pirate boarding party thing, but you’ll still get some seriously good coin for it. You mark a course for Trident, Neptune’s moon, where Colonel Dregg will be waiting for you. I guess you were right all along, sort of anyway. As of right now. You ARE the captain of the One Way or the Otter. *COMMAND ARC - UNDERCOVER PIRATE ENDING ACHIEVED - CONGRATULATIONS - GAME OVER*`,

			Text:               `You are, definitively, out of ideas. This day, omg, this day has just sucked. In your head, you’re going to use this ripped piece of uniform as a metaphor. Like, have a look at this ripped uniform, Mr. Space Pirate. This ripped uniform represents our two opposing sides. Pirates vs Captains. Bad vs Good. And look where it gets us huh? It RIPS us apart yeah? I mean, just look at it. LOOK AT IT! We are so much more than our jobs yeah? Like, I get it, you’re a pirate, you board ships, hurt people, steal stuff. And I’m a captain. I fly cool ships, I order people around. I drink Earl Grey ridiculously hot. I’m awesome. But that doesn’t mean that we’re that different. You are formulating all this out in your head when the pirate speaks up and breaks your train of thought. Which is a bloody shame, because you were really on to something there. “Ahhhh, now this is interesting!” the pirate expounds. “This patch of cloth is from an officer’s uniform. See this marking here?” the pirate points to a glyph on the uniform. You actually hadn’t seen this initially. You were too busy trying to get to the bridge in one piece and save the day. “Oh yeah, in fact, this isn’t from just any officer uniform, little otter, this marking indicates its from the captain’s uniform. Mhmm. Seems there’s a bit of a controversy over who the captain is on this ship.” the pirate explains. You’re about to tell him that you are, in fact, the captain, but the pirate rambles on. “See, I need the captain to give me the storage bay code so I don’t have to self-destruct this little betty of a ship instead of making off with my hydrocarbons. If I get the storage bay code, I can then I can just calmly, and, respectively, steal all the hydrocarbons. If I don’t get the code. I blows the whole ship. Now I figures this mug is the captain (the pirate points to the otter with a large patch of cloth missing from his uniform) but I cants prove it, ya know? But if this cloth matches that rip in his uniform exactly? Well then, then I’ve got my captain.” the pirate says insidiously. You really don’t like his tone. The pirate walks over to the electro-field and extracts the otter with a patch missing from his uniform. The pirate gruffly places the ripped cloth over the hole in the uniform. It’s a perfect match. “Well. Well. Well. I knew it.” the pirate drolls. The captain shoots you look of pure anger. You shrug and smile as your memory starts to come back to you. It’s true, you actually aren’t the captain of the One Way or the Otter. In fact, you remember you’re actually a pretty bad cook on this ship. After one of you experimental souffles ended up causing a hull breach, the captain decided to put you in cryo-sleep until they made port. The pirates clearly boarded the ship while you were in cryo, and chased the captain to his quarters. He was able to jam the door and escape, but not before he ripped his uniform. And now you’ve basically outed the captain, who was probably trying to stay quiet long enough until a distress signal could get out. You sheepishly shrug as the captain gives over the hydrocarbon bay code. The pirate tosses you all back into the electro-field and scampers off to claim his booty. The rest of the otters in the electro-field glare at you. No hydrocarbons means no bonuses for any of the members of the crew. “Look, I’ll make this up to you. When we get back to port, I’ll make souffles!” you exclaim. The volume of exasperated groans and curses that follow are almost enough to convince you that they don’t want your souffles. Almost. *COMMAND ARC - JUST A COOK ENDING ACHIEVED - CONGRATULATIONS - GAME OVER*`,

So you start with how you are a prisoner on this ship, captured by this evil crew over sheer jealousy because of how gorgeous you are. That’s right. You were minding your own business. Looking tasty. And BAM. These haters got out their hateraide and just started hatin. Next thing you know, you are a prisoner, but it’s okay, because you have precious intel. That’s right. You’ve been spying the whole time you’ve been on this bucket, and guess what space pirate, this ship isn’t carrying hydrocarbons, oh no. no sir. This ship is carrying alien pudding. I know, I know. It sounds crazy. But it’s the best damn pudding you’ve ever tasted. It’s better than snack-pak pudding. It’s better than grandma’s pudding. But wait, there’s more. You are just starting to tell the space pirate how there’s actually a contingent of space marines on board the One Way or the Otter that are being transported to a terraforming colony full of Xenomorphs when the space pirate bashes you over the head with the butt of his blaster. The world spins and sways and your vision starts to go black. You were just getting to the good part and then you were going to pull your awesome move. Ugh. Uncle Jack would be so disappointed.
